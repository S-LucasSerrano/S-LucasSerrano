# About me
Hello! My name is **Sergio**. I’m a technical designer and gameplay programmer and I am here on GitHub sharing code!

I mastered `Unity` and `C#`, but also have experience working with `Unreal`, `C` or `JavaScript`.

As a designer, I offer solutions that push players’ actions and emotions toward the desired experience. During my journey, I’ve focused on gameplay design, real-time mechanics, moment-to-moment interactions and game feel.

> - I also upload the source code of some of my games to GitHub → [Guns 'N' Ghosts](https://github.com/S-LucasSerrano/GunsNGhosts)

As a programmer, I implement character controls, enemy AI and other gameplay elements, I build systems that allow other designers to easily add content to the game and I develop tools that extend the engine functionality to facilitate the work of the whole team. I've worked on a great variety of projects for PC, mobile, VR and even web. I always focus on writing clean and human-readable code with an architecture that makes it scalable and reusable.

I love both worlds and I bring them together with my role as a **Technical Designer**: I prototype ideas and quickly iterate on them to find what is best for the game, I can communicate with both departments on their own terms, I can directly fine-tune gameplay in code and I understand the technical state and limitations of the project, offering design solutions that make the most out of them.
